Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is process that combines engineering principles, problem solving skills and programming languages to design, develop, Test, implement and maintain software products   

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering differs from traditional programming and SDLC  in several aspects namely:  

Systematic approach - Software engineering is systematic approach to software development, whereas traditional programming is often an improvised process  

Engineering Principles – Often explorative measures such as trial and error or intuition are used in traditional programming, whereas software engineering applies engineering principles such as design patterns, testing and version control, to software development  

Focus on Quality – software engineering puts emphasis in producing high quality software products, whereas emphasis on speed and cost are considered over quality in traditional programming  

Iterative Development – Traditional programing follows a systematic and analytical development process, whereas software engineering involves iterative development, where software is developed in cycles, with each cycle building upon the previous one.  

Collaborations – Stakeholders, customers and team members collaborate in software engineering, whereas traditional programming involves individual work  

Testing and Verification – traditional programming often focuses on testing at the end of the development cycle, whereas software engineering emphasizes testing and verification throughout the development process  

Maintenance – Software engineering often puts strong emphasis on the importance of maintenance and evolution, whereas traditional programming mostly views maintenance as second thought  

Software engineering is a systematic approach to software development which applies engineering principles, it involves the factors mentioned above and is different from traditional programming when the above factors are considered  

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Agile is flexible and iterative approach to project management that emphasizes the collaboration, customer satisfaction and rapid delivery  

Waterfall is systematic and sequential approach to project management that involves breaking down projects into certain phases, with each phase building on the previous one, a project plan is created upfront with each phase completed before moving on to next one.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Key characteristics of Agile:  

Iterative and Incremental – It involves the breaking down of projects into smaller, manageable parts and delivers small increments of working software to customers. 

Flexible and Adaptable – Agile allows for changes to the project scope, requirements, or timelines are needed.  

Collaborative – Agile methods promote the collaboration of stakeholders, customers and team members.  

Customer Centric – Agile prioritizes customer satisfaction and delivers working software that meets customer needs.  

Key characteristics of Waterfall: 

Linear & Sequential – Waterfall entails breaking down the project into distinctive phases, with each phase building on the previous one  

Structured & Predictable - Waterfall provides a clear plan and timeline for the project, with each phase completed before moving on to the next one.  

Less Flexible - Waterfall is less adaptable to changes in project scope, requirements and timeline. 

Customer Driven – Waterfall prioritizes meeting the customer’s requirements but may not involve direct customer feedback throughout the project.

Agile and Waterfall are two distinctive project management methods that cater to different needs and team dynamics. Project complexity, Team Dynamics, Customer involvement and Project timeline are factors to be considered when choosing the best methods  

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, analyzing, specifying. Validating and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. The goal of requirements engineering is to ensure that the software system meets the needs and expectations of its users, stakeholders and the organization. 

Software design principles are guidelines and best practices that help developers create software that is maintainable, scalable efficient and easy to understand  

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity refers to breaking down a complex software system into smaller, independent and self-contained components or modules.  

Improve Maintainability - With modular design, changes can be mad to individual modules without affecting the entire system, making it easier to maintain and update the software  

Improved Scalability - Modular design allows for easier additions of new features or modules, making it easier to scale the system as needed  

In modular software, testing is done at the modular level, rather than at the system level, the approach allows for Unit Testing, Intergration Testing, System Testing

6 Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Unit Testing – Checks if software components are fulfilling functionalities or not  

                  Error can be detected at an early stage saving time and money to fix it  

Intergration Testing – Checks data flow from one module to other modules,  

                         Big bang, top-down, bottom-up, hybrid 

System Testing – Evaluates both functional and non-functional needs for the testing  

                   It aims at determining if the application conforms to tits business requirements                                                         

Acceptance Testing – Checks the requirements of a specifications or contract are met as per its delivery 

  Alpha testing – Testing that is carried out by testers or internal employees at the developer site  

     Beta testing – User acceptance testing done by the end-user at the end-user site  
 

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes in software code, documents, or other digital assets over time.

There are three types of version control systems, which are Centralized version control Systems, where a single server stores all versions of the asset.  Distributed version control systems, where multiple copies of assets are stored on servers or devices and Cloud-based version control systems, where the asset is stored and managed online   

GIt – is a tool used for source code management, it is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together  

Azure DevOps is tool provided by Microsoft which offer a wide range of features to support software development

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

A software project manager is crucial member of a software development team, responsible for overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of a software project 

Challenges faced in Managing Software Projects: 

Managing evolving requirements and changing user needs 

Maintaining system stability and performance  

Balancing competing priorities and stakeholder expectations  

Managing knowledge transfer and team collaboration  

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance ensures smooth operation, reliability and longevity of software systems by addressing issues, improving functionality and keeping the software aligned with changing requirements and technologies. 

Software maintenance ensures smooth operation, reliability and longevity of software systems by addressing issues, improving functionality and keeping the software aligned with changing requirements and technologies. 

Corrective Maintenance – it aims to restore the software to its original working state  

Adaptive Maintenance – it involves modifying the software to update changes in the environment  

Perfective Maintenace- it focuses on enhancing the software’s performance, functionality or usability to meet changing customer demands or improve overall quality. 

Preventive Maintenance- It involves regular checks and updates to prevent errors or bugs from occurring. 

Maintenance is a crucial part of the software lifecycle because it ensures the software functions correctly, also performs well, adapts to any change, not only meeting customer requirements, as well as save costs, which leads to increased customer satisfaction and long-term viability.
